# CarouselView Challenge

Following up on the [CollectionView Challenge](https://github.com/pauldipietro/CollectionViewChallenge), the CarouselView Challenge is aimed at using the new [CarouselView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/carouselview/) in the context of real-world apps.

_Note: Some functionality may not be (fully) implemented yet as of this time. We're working to make sure that it is, but we still want your feedback on what's available now!_

For more details, check out the [preview documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/carouselview/).

## Challenge Quick Start

1. Fork this repository; you can run the solution to see a welcome page with similar instructions.
2. Open `CarouselViewChallengePage.xaml`
3. Replicate functionality from another project/app where you can use a carousel. If you need to, you can replace any data with placeholders.
4. Submit a pull request of your progress back to this repository. Please include the following feedback:
   - Comparison screenshots of your results! If you really want to go the extra mile, video is awesome to see, too.
   - Your experience using `CarouselView` (Any difficulties?)
   - What would you like to see next?
